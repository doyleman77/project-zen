on going project

I hope this to be a project that I can add onto over a long time, enhancing and refining. A project that you can enjoy, rather than play.  Similar to watching fish in a pond, or a tank - I want to build a sim type environment that occurs in real time, and which the entities interact amongst themselves without any persuasions.


ToDo:
---------
* ~~Throw .cpp and .hpp into seperate directories~~
* ~~Throw images into a directory, allow them to load on multiple OS'~~
* ~~Create a Timer class, begin frame managing~~
* Particle Engine
* Frame per second / logic capping
* Seperate Image from Entity
* Create animation class
