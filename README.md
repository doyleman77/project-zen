on going project

I hope this to be a project that I can add onto over a long time, enhancing and refining. A project that you can enjoy, rather than play.  Similar to watching fish in a pond, or a tank - I want to build a sim type environment that occurs in real time, and which the entities interact amongst themselves without any persuasions.

More to follow.
